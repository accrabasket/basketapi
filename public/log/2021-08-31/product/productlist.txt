We therefore offer a very wide range: standard jams, exclusive fruit fillings and organic products with delightful flavours and a high fruit content. Are you interested in delicious fruit jam? This page gives you a glimpse into the world of our jam. We discuss the different ingredients in jam and how we prepare the fruit product.","category_id":103,"custom_info":null,"brand_name":"Geurts","bullet_desc":["The four key ingredients of jam: Fruit, sugar, a gelling agent and an acidulant. Those are the four key ingredients of jam. We use these ingredients at the optimal ratio. We are able to prepare the jam within a short space of time by cooking it in a vacuum kettle without a stirring mechanism. That way, the jam retains its optimal flavour and structure","The best fruit, guaranteed: The fruit in our jam is of the best quality. We are confident in the fruit we source from abroad. We have enjoyed excellent relationships with the fruit farmers who supply us for many years. They understand that we have exceptionally high quality standards. We then ensure the colour and flavour of the fruit is optimally preserved by allowing the jam to reduce in our vacuum kettle. In addition, our vacuum kettle has no stirring mechanism, so the fruit remains whole. We are not satisfied with \u2018good\u2019, only with \u2018the very best\u2019!","The sweet secret of success: Sugar is indispensable in the jam making process. It gives it a sweet taste, the right consistency, and it contributes to preservation of the colour and aroma of the jam. Besides, sugar has a preservative effect. The right sugar content gives our jam a longer shelf life. Thanks to modern technology, it is now possible to make jam with a higher fruit content and a lower sugar content, but with a shelf life that is just as long. This is healthier, and besides, it brings out the flavour of the fruit better.","Our gelling agent, pectin: Pectin gives jam the right structure, thickness and spreadability. All are very important for preparing the perfect jam. Pectin also ensures the fruit does not need to be too thickened while cooking. This means cooking time is shorter and the taste and colour of the fruit is preserved far more effectively. The addition of pectin therefore ensures better jam.","Acidulant, citric acid: It is important for the jam to have the right balance between sweet and sour. Citric acid regulates this balance. In addition, this acidity regulator ensures the optimal functioning of pectin."],"nutrition":"","attribute":{"2055":{"id":1659,"merchant_product_code":"76020","product_id":1992,"attribute_id":2055,"store_id":4,"merchant_id":4,"price":"12.49","stock":37,"created_date":"2019-12-26 17:18:58","updated_date":"2021-05-05 14:14:13","attribute_name":"Strawberry Jam","discount_type":"","discount_value":"0","unit":"gm","quantity":450,"actual_price":"12.49"}}},"2002":{"product_id":2002,"price":"14.49","product_name":"Broken Vermicelli Pasta","discount_type":"","discount_value":"0","product_desc":"Explore KTC'S Range of Products for both the Food Industry and Retail: Sourced from around the globe, our product range contains everything from oils and fats, to pulses, lentils, rice and pasta, flours and coatings and our 100% pure coconut oils.","category_id":91,"custom_info":null,"brand_name":"KTC Edibles","bullet_desc":null,"nutrition":"","attribute":{"2065":{"id":1669,"merchant_product_code":"80880","product_id":2002,"attribute_id":2065,"store_id":4,"merchant_id":4,"price":"14.49","stock":32,"created_date":"2019-12-26 17:18:58","updated_date":"2021-05-05 14:14:15","attribute_name":"Broken Vermicelli Pasta","discount_type":"","discount_value":"0","unit":"gm","quantity":500,"actual_price":"14.49"}}},"2051":{"product_id":2051,"price":"9.49","product_name":"Vegetable Cooking Oil","discount_type":"","discount_value":"0","product_desc":"","category_id":92,"custom_info":null,"brand_name":"Golden Drop","bullet_desc":["Premium Nutrition: Golden Drop Vegetable oil is not only rich in taste but it also guarantees richness of its content.

Launched in the US in 1979, it completely redefined the premium vodka landscape, becoming synonymous with art, culture and nightlife. By starting a revolution in cocktail creation and launching a range of flavors never before seen on the market, Absolut became an icon in its own right. Here you can discover some of Absolut\u2019s most popular flavors and products, and see for yourself why it is still regarded today as the true taste of vodka around the globe.\r\nAbsolut Vodka was first launched in New York in 1979. It soon became the talk of the town, in the US and eventually of the world. But the recipe behind the clean and natural taste of Absolut is actually older than 30 years. So is the 18th century medicine bottle found in an antique store in Stockholm, Sweden that gave inspiration to the iconic Absolut Vodka bottle.","category_id":76,"custom_info":{"Ingredients":"Water and Winter Wheat"},"brand_name":"Absolut","bullet_desc":["What does true taste of vodka taste like?\nAbsolut Vodka is a Swedish vodka made exclusively from natural ingredients, and unlike some other vodkas, it doesn\u2019t contain any added sugar. In fact Absolut is as clean as vodka can be. Still, it has a certain taste: Rich, full-bodied and complex, yet smooth and mellow with a distinct character of grain, followed by a hint of dried fruit.","Why change what's perfect?\nIn 1879, Lars Olsson Smith introduced the continuous distillation with which he made Absolut Rent Br\u00e4nnvin. Instead of the usual three or four times, the vodka was distilled an infinite number of times. 100 years later, it was reintroduced as Absolut. Just as then, Absolut is produced in Ahus, L.O. Smith\u2019s birth town. Also the place where the wheat used for making the vodka is grown. And since the way Absolut is made won\u2019t change, neither will the true taste of vodka.","Keeping natural ingredients natural\nThe main ingredients in Absolut Vodka are water and winter wheat. The water comes from a deep well in Ahus where it\u2019s protected from impurities. Winter wheat differs from other crops: it\u2019s sown in fall, and harvested the next one. Days in between it grows under the Swedish snow developing its hard grain. Also, the use of fertilizers is minimized."],"nutrition":"","attribute":{"849":{"id":452,"merchant_product_code":"14742","product_id":739,"attribute_id":849,"store_id":4,"merchant_id":4,"price":"88.99","stock":9,"created_date":"2018-12-04 15:45:19","updated_date":"2020-07-25 18:39:03","attribute_name":"Vodka Blue","discount_type":"","discount_value":"","unit":"liter","quantity":1,"actual_price":"88.99"}}},"741":{"product_id":741,"price":"99.99","product_name":"Gold Rum","discount_type":"","discount_value":"0","product_desc":"BACARDI Gold rum is the proud creation of the Maestros de Ron Bacardi.

Having a unique formulation, Active laundry detergent increases the brightness and durability of clothes and leaves a persistent fragrance of spring flowers on the clothes. This product is designed in such a way that prevents excessive foam accumulation inside the washing machine or in manual washing.","category_id":64,"custom_info":{"Applications":"This product is recommended for removing stains and very dirty clothes of different textures as well as formal and silk clothes and curtain.","Warning":"Keep away from direct sunlight and children.\r\nIf swallowed, consult a specialist.\r\nUse gloves for manual washing.","Directions For Use":"Hand washing: If clothes are washed manually appropriately, they will have a longer lifespan than machine washing. Depending on the weight and dirt of clothes, add 1 or 2 caps of laundry liquid to water. Soak clothes in the aqueous solution for a few minutes. Rub the clothes manually for a few minutes and then rinse and dry. Soak the clothes further in the aqueous laundry solution in the case of further stains on clothes. For white clothes needing a bleaching liquid, add the bleaching liquid to the solution, then wash, rinse and dry clothes.\r\nMachine washing: depending on the weight and dirt of clothes, pour 2 to 3 caps of laundry liquid in the washing machine. If the clothes should be soaked before washing, wash colored, white, black, fluffy and delicate fabrics separately.\r\nNote: this product can be used for all kinds of clothes. However, back laundry liquid is recommended to be used for black clothes."},"brand_name":"Active","bullet_desc":["High cleanliness and stain removal power.","A pleasant fragrance.","Prevention of corrosion of internal components of washing machines.","High detergency.","East of use."],"nutrition":"","attribute":{"3860":{"id":3401,"merchant_product_code":null,"product_id":3852,"attribute_id":3860,"store_id":15,"merchant_id":11,"price":"37.00","stock":16,"created_date":"2021-06-02 06:37:01","updated_date":"2021-06-02 06:37:01","attribute_name":"General Laundry Liquid Detergent","discount_type":"percent","discount_value":"20","unit":"liter","quantity":4.5,"actual_price":"29.60"}}},"3853":{"product_id":3853,"price":"19.00","product_name":"After Sport Shower Gel","discount_type":"","discount_value":"0","product_desc":"","category_id":62,"custom_info":null,"brand_name":"Adidas","bullet_desc":["Dermatologically tested and ph balanced formula.","Multi benefit 3 in 1 formula: hydrates your body, cleanses your face, conditions your hair.","Suitable for everyday use."],"nutrition":"","attribute":{"3861":{"id":3402,"merchant_product_code":null,"product_id":3853,"attribute_id":3861,"store_id":15,"merchant_id":11,"price":"19.00","stock":10,"created_date":"2021-06-02 06:37:01","updated_date":"2021-06-02 06:37:01","attribute_name":"After Sport Shower Gel","discount_type":"","discount_value":"0","unit":"ml","quantity":250,"actual_price":"19.00"}}},"3854":{"product_id":3854,"price":"19.00","product_name":"Climacool Shower Gel","discount_type":"","discount_value":"0","product_desc":"","category_id":62,"custom_info":null,"brand_name":"Adidas","bullet_desc":["Formulated with move activated fresh capsules.","Adidas shower gel line helps to maintain your skin's natural balance and awake your senses.","Long lasting cool and fresh fragrance with zesty mix of juicy citrus notes and bright floral tones.","Dermatologically tested and pH balanced formula suitable for everyday use."],"nutrition":"","attribute":{"3862":{"id":3403,"merchant_product_code":null,"product_id":3854,"attribute_id":3862,"store_id":15,"merchant_id":11,"price":"19.00","stock":6,"created_date":"2021-06-02 06:37:01","updated_date":"2021-06-02 06:37:01","attribute_name":"Climacool Shower Gel","discount_type":"","discount_value":"0","unit":"ml","quantity":250,"actual_price":"19.00"}}},"3855":{"product_id":3855,"price":"19.00","product_name":"Climacool 3in1 Shower Gel","discount_type":"","discount_value":"0","product_desc":"","category_id":62,"custom_info":null,"brand_name":"Adidas","bullet_desc":["Formulated with move activated fresh capsules.","Adidas shower gel line helps to maintain your skin's natural balance and awake your senses.","Long lasting cool and fresh fragrance with zesty mix of juicy citrus notes and bright floral tones.","Dermatologically tested and pH balanced formula suitable for everyday use."],"nutrition":"","attribute":{"3863":{"id":3404,"merchant_product_code":null,"product_id":3855,"attribute_id":3863,"store_id":15,"merchant_id":11,"price":"19.00","stock":1,"created_date":"2021-06-02 06:37:01","updated_date":"2021-06-02 06:37:01","attribute_name":"Climacool 3in1 Shower Gel","discount_type":"","discount_value":"0","unit":"ml","quantity":250,"actual_price":"19.00"}}},"3856":{"product_id":3856,"price":"19.00","product_name":"Active Start Shower Gel","discount_type":"","discount_value":"0","product_desc":"","category_id":62,"custom_info":null,"brand_name":"Adidas","bullet_desc":["Formulated with Pro-Vitamin B5 to revitalize your body.","Featuring aromatic mint and lemon notes mixed with cedar wood and musk.","Multi-benefit 3 in 1 formula: hydrates your body, cleanses your face, conditions your hair.","pH-balanced formula, suitable for everyday use."],"nutrition":"","attribute":{"3864":{"id":3405,"merchant_product_code":null,"product_id":3856,"attribute_id":3864,"store_id":15,"merchant_id":11,"price":"19.00","stock":5,"created_date":"2021-06-02 06:37:01","updated_date":"2021-06-02 06:37:01","attribute_name":"Active Start Shower Gel","discount_type":"","discount_value":"0","unit":"ml","quantity":250,"actual_price":"19.00"}}},"3857":{"product_id":3857,"price":"19.00","product_name":"Pure Game Relaxing 3in1 Shower Gel","discount_type":"","discount_value":"0","product_desc":"","category_id":62,"custom_info":null,"brand_name":"Adidas","bullet_desc":["With guaiac extract and relaxing fragrance to sooth your body;

Launched in the US in 1979, it completely redefined the premium vodka landscape, becoming synonymous with art, culture and nightlife. By starting a revolution in cocktail creation and launching a range of flavors never before seen on the market, Absolut became an icon in its own right. Here you can discover some of Absolut\u2019s most popular flavors and products, and see for yourself why it is still regarded today as the true taste of vodka around the globe.\r\nAbsolut Vodka was first launched in New York in 1979. It soon became the talk of the town, in the US and eventually of the world. But the recipe behind the clean and natural taste of Absolut is actually older than 30 years. So is the 18th century medicine bottle found in an antique store in Stockholm, Sweden that gave inspiration to the iconic Absolut Vodka bottle.","category_id":76,"custom_info":{"Ingredients":"Water and Winter Wheat"},"brand_name":"Absolut","bullet_desc":["What does true taste of vodka taste like?\nAbsolut Vodka is a Swedish vodka made exclusively from natural ingredients, and unlike some other vodkas, it doesn\u2019t contain any added sugar. In fact Absolut is as clean as vodka can be. Still, it has a certain taste: Rich, full-bodied and complex, yet smooth and mellow with a distinct character of grain, followed by a hint of dried fruit.","Why change what's perfect?\nIn 1879, Lars Olsson Smith introduced the continuous distillation with which he made Absolut Rent Br\u00e4nnvin. Instead of the usual three or four times, the vodka was distilled an infinite number of times. 100 years later, it was reintroduced as Absolut. Just as then, Absolut is produced in Ahus, L.O. Smith\u2019s birth town. Also the place where the wheat used for making the vodka is grown. And since the way Absolut is made won\u2019t change, neither will the true taste of vodka.","Keeping natural ingredients natural\nThe main ingredients in Absolut Vodka are water and winter wheat. The water comes from a deep well in Ahus where it\u2019s protected from impurities. Winter wheat differs from other crops: it\u2019s sown in fall, and harvested the next one. Days in between it grows under the Swedish snow developing its hard grain.
