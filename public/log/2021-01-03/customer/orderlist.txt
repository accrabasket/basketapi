Here you can discover some of Absolut\u2019s most popular flavors and products, and see for yourself why it is still regarded today as the true taste of vodka around the globe.\r\nAbsolut Vodka was first launched in New York in 1979. It soon became the talk of the town, in the US and eventually of the world. But the recipe behind the clean and natural taste of Absolut is actually older than 30 years. So is the 18th century medicine bottle found in an antique store in Stockholm, Sweden that gave inspiration to the iconic Absolut Vodka bottle.","default_discount_type":"","default_discount_value":"0","category_id":76,"custom_info":"{\"Ingredients\":\"Water and Winter Wheat\"}","brand_name":"Absolut","commission_type":"flat","commission_value":"0.0000","discount_type":"percent","discount_value":"5","unit":"liter","quantity":1},"product_image_data":[{"id":783,"type":"product","image_id":739,"image_name":"739_1545100747.jpg"}]},"status":"active","created_by":1082,"updated_by":0},"246":{"id":3335,"order_id":"order_m2_640","merchant_product_id":246,"number_of_item":1,"amount":"3.60","commission_amount":"0.36","discount_amount":"0.00","tax_amount":0,"product_dump":{"product_details":{"id":246,"price":"3.60","product_id":401,"merchant_id":3,"store_id":2,"merchant_product_code":"5449000011","product_name":"Fanta Orange Regular Can","product_desc":"Bright, bubbly and a popular favourite, Fanta Orange is a soft drink with a tingly, fruity taste.
