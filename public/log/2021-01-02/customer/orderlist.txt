It holds a position of importance both in the animal kingdom and in human legend and ritual, and it is from the fruit of this mystical tree that Amarula cream is borne. Once the ripe marula fruit has been gathered, the stones are removed and the flesh is separated from the skin before it is fermented under conditions similar to winemaking.

It is then blended with our velvety cream to create the smooth taste of Amarula - best savoured over ice, preferably with a view. On the wide-open plains of Africa grows a tree uncultivated by man. The marula tree, or \u2018Sclerocarya Birrea\u2019, only grows in one area on the entire planet - the warm, frost-free regions of subequatorial Africa. It holds a position of importance both in the animal kingdom and in human legend and ritual, and it is from the fruit of this mystical tree that Amarula cream is borne. Once the ripe marula fruit has been gathered, the stones are removed and the flesh is separated from the skin before it is fermented under conditions similar to winemaking. After fermentation, the marula wine is distilled, first in column stills and then in copper pot stills.","default_discount_type":"","default_discount_value":"0","category_id":76,"custom_info":"","brand_name":"Amarula","commission_type":"","commission_value":"0.0000","discount_type":"","discount_value":"0","unit":"ml","quantity":750},"product_image_data":[{"id":2641,"type":"product","image_id":740,"image_name":"D661.jpg"}]},"status":"active","created_by":684,"updated_by":0}}},"order_m7_2":{"order_details":{"id":1305,"user_id":684,"order_id":"order_m7_2","parent_order_id":"order_P_87","store_id":7,"merchant_id":7,"shipping_address_id":227,"amount":"103.00","payable_amount":"103.00","partial_paid_amount":"0.00","discount_amount":"0.00","commission_amount":"0.00","tax_amount":"0.0000","shipping_charges":"0.00","payment_status":"unpaid","order_status":"cancelled","delivery_date":"2020-08-12","time_slot_id":4,"coupon_code":"","coupon_discount_amount":"0.00","created_date":"2020-08-11 17:13:37","updated_date":"2020-08-11 17:13:37","overall_rating":0,"rider_rating":0,"comment":""},"orderitem":{"2727":{"id":2971,"order_id":"order_m7_2","merchant_product_id":2727,"number_of_item":1,"amount":"40.00","commission_amount":"0.00","discount_amount":"0.00","tax_amount":0,"product_dump":{"product_details":{"id":2727,"price":"40.00","product_id":3141,"merchant_id":7,"store_id":7,"product_name":"Blueberries","product_desc":"","default_discount_type":"","default_discount_value":"0","category_id":122,"custom_info":"","brand_name":"","commission_type":"","commission_value":"0.0000","discount_type":"","discount_value":"0","unit":"Pack","quantity":1},"product_image_data":[{"id":3798,"type":"product","image_id":3141,"image_name":"FAR005.jpg"}]},"status":"active","created_by":684,"updated_by":0},"2726":{"id":2970,"order_id":"order_m7_2","merchant_product_id":2726,"number_of_item":1,"amount":"8.00","commission_amount":"0.00","discount_amount":"0.00","tax_amount":0,"product_dump":{"product_details":{"id":2726,"price":"8.00","product_id":3140,"merchant_id":7,"store_id":7,"product_name":"Banana","product_desc":"","default_discount_type":"","default_discount_value":"0","category_id":122,"custom_info":"","brand_name":"","commission_type":"","commission_value":"0.0000","discount_type":"","discount_value":"0","unit":"Pcs","quantity":6},"product_image_data":[{"id":3797,"type":"product","image_id":3140,"image_name":"FAR004.jpg"}]},"status":"active","created_by":684,"updated_by":0},"2728":{"id":2969,"order_id":"order_m7_2","merchant_product_id":2728,"number_of_item":1,"amount":"40.00","commission_amount":"0.00","discount_amount":"0.00","tax_amount":0,"product_dump":{"product_details":{"id":2728,"price":"40.00","product_id":3142,"merchant_id":7,"store_id":7,"product_name":"Crunchy Broccoli","product_desc":"","default_discount_type":"","default_discount_value":"0","category_id":121,"custom_info":"","brand_name":"","commission_type":"","commission_value":"0.0000","discount_type":"","discount_value":"0","unit":"Pcs","quantity":1},"product_image_data":[{"id":3799,"type":"product","image_id":3142,"image_name":"FAR006.jpg"}]},"status":"active","created_by":684,"updated_by":0},"2725":{"id":2968,"order_id":"order_m7_2","merchant_product_id":2725,"number_of_item":1,"amount":"15.00","commission_amount":"0.00","discount_amount":"0.00","tax_amount":0,"product_dump":{"product_details":{"id":2725,"price":"15.00","product_id":3139,"merchant_id":7,"store_id":7,"product_name":"Green Baby Spinach","product_desc":"","default_discount_type":"","default_discount_value":"0","category_id":121,"custom_info":"","brand_name":"","commission_type":"","commission_value":"0.0000","discount_type":"","discount_value":"0","unit":"Pack","quantity":1},"product_image_data":[{"id":3796,"type":"product","image_id":3139,"image_name":"FAR003.jpg"}]},"status":"active","created_by":684,"updated_by":0}}},"order_m2_609":{"order_details":{"id":1303,"user_id":761,"order_id":"order_m2_609","parent_order_id":"0","store_id":2,"merchant_id":3,"shipping_address_id":235,"amount":"166.90","payable_amount":"167.90","partial_paid_amount":"0.00","discount_amount":"16.00","commission_amount":"16.69","tax_amount":"0.0000","shipping_charges":"17.00","payment_status":"unpaid","order_status":"cancelled","delivery_date":"2020-08-11","time_slot_id":6,"coupon_code":"","coupon_discount_amount":"0.00","created_date":"2020-08-11 10:56:00","updated_date":"2020-08-11 10:56:00","overall_rating":0,"rider_rating":0,"comment":""},"orderitem":{"232":{"id":2967,"order_id":"order_m2_609","merchant_product_id":232,"number_of_item":2,"amount":"6.40","commission_amount":"0.64","discount_amount":"0.00","tax_amount":0,"product_dump":{"product_details":{"id":232,"price":"3.20","product_id":387,"merchant_id":3,"store_id":2,"product_name":"Classic Soft Drink-Tin","product_desc":"Coca-Cola Classic is the world\u2019s favourite soft drink and has been enjoyed since 1886.

The marula tree, or \u2018Sclerocarya Birrea\u2019, only grows in one area on the entire planet \u2013 the warm, frost-free regions of subequatorial Africa. It holds a position of importance both in the animal kingdom and in human legend and ritual, and it is from the fruit of this mystical tree that Amarula cream is borne.\nOnce the ripe marula fruit has been gathered, the stones are removed and the flesh is separated from the skin before it is fermented under conditions similar to winemaking. After fermentation, the marula wine is distilled, first in column stills and then in copper pot stills.","default_discount_type":"","default_discount_value":"0","category_id":76,"custom_info":"","brand_name":"Amarula","commission_type":"","commission_value":"0.0000","discount_type":"","discount_value":"0","unit":"ml","quantity":750},"product_image_data":[{"id":584,"type":"product","image_id":740,"image_name":"D661.jpg"}]},"status":"active","created_by":128,"updated_by":0},"457":{"id":1864,"order_id":"order_m4_94","merchant_product_id":457,"number_of_item":1,"amount":"75.50","commission_amount":"0.00","discount_amount":"0.00","tax_amount":0,"product_dump":{"product_details":{"id":457,"price":"75.50","product_id":739,"merchant_id":4,"store_id":4,"product_name":"Vodka Blue","product_desc":"Absolut Vodka is one of the most famous vodkas in the world.
