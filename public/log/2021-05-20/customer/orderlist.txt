The marula tree, or \u2018Sclerocarya Birrea\u2019, only grows in one area on the entire planet - the warm, frost-free regions of subequatorial Africa. It holds a position of importance both in the animal kingdom and in human legend and ritual, and it is from the fruit of this mystical tree that Amarula cream is borne. Once the ripe marula fruit has been gathered, the stones are removed and the flesh is separated from the skin before it is fermented under conditions similar to winemaking.

The marula tree, or \u2018Sclerocarya Birrea\u2019, only grows in one area on the entire planet - the warm, frost-free regions of subequatorial Africa. It holds a position of importance both in the animal kingdom and in human legend and ritual, and it is from the fruit of this mystical tree that Amarula cream is borne. Once the ripe marula fruit has been gathered, the stones are removed and the flesh is separated from the skin before it is fermented under conditions similar to winemaking.
