We are able to prepare the jam within a short space of time by cooking it in a vacuum kettle without a stirring mechanism. That way, the jam retains its optimal flavour and structure","The best fruit, guaranteed: The fruit in our jam is of the best quality. We are confident in the fruit we source from abroad. We have enjoyed excellent relationships with the fruit farmers who supply us for many years. They understand that we have exceptionally high quality standards. We then ensure the colour and flavour of the fruit is optimally preserved by allowing the jam to reduce in our vacuum kettle. In addition, our vacuum kettle has no stirring mechanism, so the fruit remains whole. We are not satisfied with \u2018good\u2019, only with \u2018the very best\u2019!","The sweet secret of success: Sugar is indispensable in the jam making process. It gives it a sweet taste, the right consistency, and it contributes to preservation of the colour and aroma of the jam. Besides, sugar has a preservative effect. The right sugar content gives our jam a longer shelf life. Thanks to modern technology, it is now possible to make jam with a higher fruit content and a lower sugar content, but with a shelf life that is just as long. This is healthier, and besides, it brings out the flavour of the fruit better.","Our gelling agent, pectin: Pectin gives jam the right structure, thickness and spreadability. All are very important for preparing the perfect jam. Pectin also ensures the fruit does not need to be too thickened while cooking. This means cooking time is shorter and the taste and colour of the fruit is preserved far more effectively. The addition of pectin therefore ensures better jam.","Acidulant, citric acid: It is important for the jam to have the right balance between sweet and sour. Citric acid regulates this balance. In addition, this acidity regulator ensures the optimal functioning of pectin."],"nutrition":"","attribute":{"2055":{"id":1659,"merchant_product_code":"76020","product_id":1992,"attribute_id":2055,"store_id":4,"merchant_id":4,"price":"12.49","stock":30,"created_date":"2019-12-26 17:18:58","updated_date":"2020-12-16 15:39:22","attribute_name":"Strawberry Jam","discount_type":"","discount_value":"0","unit":"gm","quantity":450,"actual_price":"12.49"}}},"1999":{"product_id":1999,"price":"299.99","product_name":"Thai Jasmine Rice","discount_type":"","discount_value":"0","product_desc":"","category_id":82,"custom_info":null,"brand_name":"Lele","bullet_desc":null,"nutrition":"","attribute":{"2062":{"id":1666,"merchant_product_code":"80619","product_id":1999,"attribute_id":2062,"store_id":4,"merchant_id":4,"price":"299.99","stock":18,"created_date":"2019-12-26 17:18:58","updated_date":"2020-12-16 15:39:25","attribute_name":"Thai Jasmine Rice","discount_type":"","discount_value":"0","unit":"kg","quantity":25,"actual_price":"299.99"}}},"2002":{"product_id":2002,"price":"14.49","product_name":"Broken Vermicelli Pasta","discount_type":"","discount_value":"0","product_desc":"Explore KTC'S Range of Products for both the Food Industry and Retail: Sourced from around the globe, our product range contains everything from oils and fats, to pulses, lentils, rice and pasta, flours and coatings and our 100% pure coconut oils.","category_id":91,"custom_info":null,"brand_name":"KTC Edibles","bullet_desc":null,"nutrition":"","attribute":{"2065":{"id":1669,"merchant_product_code":"80880","product_id":2002,"attribute_id":2065,"store_id":4,"merchant_id":4,"price":"14.49","stock":50,"created_date":"2019-12-26 17:18:58","updated_date":"2020-12-16 15:39:24","attribute_name":"Broken Vermicelli Pasta","discount_type":"","discount_value":"0","unit":"gm","quantity":500,"actual_price":"14.49"}}},"2003":{"product_id":2003,"price":"12.99","product_name":"Sweetcorn","discount_type":"","discount_value":"0","product_desc":"Explore KTC'S Range of Products for both the Food Industry and Retail: Sourced from around the globe, our product range contains everything from oils and fats, to pulses, lentils, rice and pasta, flours and coatings and our 100% pure coconut oils.","category_id":119,"custom_info":null,"brand_name":"KTC Edibles","bullet_desc":null,"nutrition":"","attribute":{"2066":{"id":1670,"merchant_product_code":"80885","product_id":2003,"attribute_id":2066,"store_id":4,"merchant_id":4,"price":"12.99","stock":39,"created_date":"2019-12-26 17:18:58","updated_date":"2020-12-16 15:39:24","attribute_name":"Sweetcorn","discount_type":"","discount_value":"0","unit":"gm","quantity":340,"actual_price":"12.99"}}},"2051":{"product_id":2051,"price":"9.49","product_name":"Vegetable Cooking Oil","discount_type":"","discount_value":"0","product_desc":"","category_id":92,"custom_info":null,"brand_name":"Golden Drop","bullet_desc":["Premium Nutrition: Golden Drop Vegetable oil is not only rich in taste but it also guarantees richness of its content.
