In France, people simply order a \u201cjaune\u201d (yellow), knowing they\u2019ll be served a Ricard Pastis. Adding water allows Ricard to bloom, resulting in a bright louche of opaque yellow - sunshine in a glass. Paul Ricard developed Ricard in 1932 in Marseille, France. Ricard\u2019s secret recipe, unaltered since its creation, is composed of selected herbs and spices including Chinese star anise, Syrian licorice, and aromatic herbs from Provence, France. On the palate, refreshing notes of licorice and star anise are followed by gentle hints of fruits, wood, and spices. The mouth feel is medium-bodied, and the finish long and pleasant.
