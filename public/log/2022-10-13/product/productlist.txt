Do not use odex on silk, wool, mohair, leather, or non - fast colors. \nColor bleaching test: a quick, easy bleach test for colors, mix one tablespoon odex with 1\/4 cup water. Apply one drop of this solution to a hidden portion of fabric. Let stand for one minute, if there is no change in color, fabric can be safely bleached.\nAutomatic machine washing: one cup of odex per washing machine load with good laundry detergent should provide excellent cleaning results. For heavily soiled or large loads you may add more odex.\nHand washing: add 1\/8 cup odex per gallon of sudsy water for normal hand washing. Use little more odex for heavily soiled cloth. Use rubber gloves to protect your hands. \nGeneral cleaning and disinfecting:\nUse odex to clean and deodorize bathrooms and kitchens. It cleans by removing stains and killing germs that cause odors.\nToilets bowls: pour in 1\/2 cup of odex, brush entire bowl. Let stand ten minutes and flush.\nKitchen sinks, floors, tubs and tiles clean with a solution of 3\/4 cup odex per gallon of warm water. For stains, pour odex undiluted on stained spots, let stand for ten minutes, then rinse well with water.

Here you can discover some of Absolut\u2019s most popular flavors and products, and see for yourself why it is still regarded today as the true taste of vodka around the globe.\r\nAbsolut Vodka was first launched in New York in 1979. It soon became the talk of the town, in the US and eventually of the world. But the recipe behind the clean and natural taste of Absolut is actually older than 30 years.

In fact Absolut is as clean as vodka can be. Still, it has a certain taste: Rich, full-bodied and complex, yet smooth and mellow with a distinct character of grain, followed by a hint of dried fruit.","Why change what's perfect?\nIn 1879, Lars Olsson Smith introduced the continuous distillation with which he made Absolut Rent Br\u00e4nnvin. Instead of the usual three or four times, the vodka was distilled an infinite number of times. 100 years later, it was reintroduced as Absolut. Just as then, Absolut is produced in Ahus, L.O. Smith\u2019s birth town. Also the place where the wheat used for making the vodka is grown. And since the way Absolut is made won\u2019t change, neither will the true taste of vodka.","Keeping natural ingredients natural\nThe main ingredients in Absolut Vodka are water and winter wheat. The water comes from a deep well in Ahus where it\u2019s protected from impurities. Winter wheat differs from other crops: it\u2019s sown in fall, and harvested the next one. Days in between it grows under the Swedish snow developing its hard grain.
