Do not use ODEX on silk, wool, mohair, leather, or non-fast colors.\nColor bleaching test: a quick, easy bleach test for colors, mix one tablespoon ODEX with 1\/4 cup water. Apply one drop of this solution to a hidden portion of fabric. Let stand for one minute, if there is no change in color, fabric can be safely bleached.\nAutomatic machine washing: one cup of ODEX per washing machine load with good laundry detergent should provide excellent cleaning results. For heavily soiled or large loads you may add more ODEX.\nHand washing: add 1\/8 cup ODEX per gallon of sudsy water for normal hand washing. Use little more ODEX for heavily soiled cloth. Use rubber gloves to protect your hands. \nGENERAL CLEANING AND DISINFECTING:\nUse ODEX to clean and deodorize bathrooms and kitchens. It cleans by removing stains and killing germs that cause odors.\nToilets bowls: pour in 1\/2 cup of ODEX, brush entire bowl. Let stand ten minutes and flush.\nKitchen sinks, floors, tubs and tiles clean with a solution of 3\/4 cup ODEX per gallon of warm water.
