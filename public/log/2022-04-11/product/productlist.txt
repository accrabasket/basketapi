That is why Geurts makes the delicacies that consumers want. We therefore offer a very wide range: standard jams, exclusive fruit fillings and organic products with delightful flavours and a high fruit content. Are you interested in delicious fruit jam? This page gives you a glimpse into the world of our jam. We discuss the different ingredients in jam and how we prepare the fruit product.","category_id":103,"custom_info":null,"brand_name":"Geurts","bullet_desc":["The four key ingredients of jam: Fruit, sugar, a gelling agent and an acidulant. Those are the four key ingredients of jam. We use these ingredients at the optimal ratio. We are able to prepare the jam within a short space of time by cooking it in a vacuum kettle without a stirring mechanism. That way, the jam retains its optimal flavour and structure","The best fruit, guaranteed: The fruit in our jam is of the best quality. We are confident in the fruit we source from abroad. We have enjoyed excellent relationships with the fruit farmers who supply us for many years. They understand that we have exceptionally high quality standards. We then ensure the colour and flavour of the fruit is optimally preserved by allowing the jam to reduce in our vacuum kettle. In addition, our vacuum kettle has no stirring mechanism, so the fruit remains whole. We are not satisfied with \u2018good\u2019, only with \u2018the very best\u2019!","The sweet secret of success: Sugar is indispensable in the jam making process. It gives it a sweet taste, the right consistency, and it contributes to preservation of the colour and aroma of the jam. Besides, sugar has a preservative effect. The right sugar content gives our jam a longer shelf life. Thanks to modern technology, it is now possible to make jam with a higher fruit content and a lower sugar content, but with a shelf life that is just as long. This is healthier, and besides, it brings out the flavour of the fruit better.","Our gelling agent, pectin: Pectin gives jam the right structure, thickness and spreadability. All are very important for preparing the perfect jam. Pectin also ensures the fruit does not need to be too thickened while cooking. This means cooking time is shorter and the taste and colour of the fruit is preserved far more effectively. The addition of pectin therefore ensures better jam.","Acidulant, citric acid: It is important for the jam to have the right balance between sweet and sour. Citric acid regulates this balance.
