So is the 18th century medicine bottle found in an antique store in Stockholm, Sweden that gave inspiration to the iconic Absolut Vodka bottle.","category_id":76,"custom_info":{"Ingredients":"Water and Winter Wheat"},"brand_name":"Absolut","bullet_desc":["What does true taste of vodka taste like?\nAbsolut Vodka is a Swedish vodka made exclusively from natural ingredients, and unlike some other vodkas, it doesn\u2019t contain any added sugar. In fact Absolut is as clean as vodka can be. Still, it has a certain taste: Rich, full-bodied and complex, yet smooth and mellow with a distinct character of grain, followed by a hint of dried fruit.","Why change what's perfect?\nIn 1879, Lars Olsson Smith introduced the continuous distillation with which he made Absolut Rent Br\u00e4nnvin. Instead of the usual three or four times, the vodka was distilled an infinite number of times. 100 years later, it was reintroduced as Absolut. Just as then, Absolut is produced in Ahus, L.O. Smith\u2019s birth town. Also the place where the wheat used for making the vodka is grown. And since the way Absolut is made won\u2019t change, neither will the true taste of vodka.","Keeping natural ingredients natural\nThe main ingredients in Absolut Vodka are water and winter wheat. The water comes from a deep well in Ahus where it\u2019s protected from impurities. Winter wheat differs from other crops: it\u2019s sown in fall, and harvested the next one. Days in between it grows under the Swedish snow developing its hard grain. Also, the use of fertilizers is minimized."],"nutrition":"","attribute":{"849":{"id":452,"merchant_product_code":"14742","product_id":739,"attribute_id":849,"store_id":4,"merchant_id":4,"price":"88.99","stock":9,"created_date":"2018-12-04 15:45:19","updated_date":"2020-07-25 18:39:03","attribute_name":"Vodka Blue","discount_type":"","discount_value":"","unit":"liter","quantity":1,"actual_price":"88.99"}}},"741":{"product_id":741,"price":"99.99","product_name":"Gold Rum","discount_type":"","discount_value":"0","product_desc":"BACARDI Gold rum is the proud creation of the Maestros de Ron Bacardi.

Launched in the US in 1979, it completely redefined the premium vodka landscape, becoming synonymous with art, culture and nightlife. By starting a revolution in cocktail creation and launching a range of flavors never before seen on the market, Absolut became an icon in its own right. Here you can discover some of Absolut\u2019s most popular flavors and products, and see for yourself why it is still regarded today as the true taste of vodka around the globe.\r\nAbsolut Vodka was first launched in New York in 1979. It soon became the talk of the town, in the US and eventually of the world. But the recipe behind the clean and natural taste of Absolut is actually older than 30 years. So is the 18th century medicine bottle found in an antique store in Stockholm, Sweden that gave inspiration to the iconic Absolut Vodka bottle.","category_id":76,"custom_info":{"Ingredients":"Water and Winter Wheat"},"brand_name":"Absolut","bullet_desc":["What does true taste of vodka taste like?\nAbsolut Vodka is a Swedish vodka made exclusively from natural ingredients, and unlike some other vodkas, it doesn\u2019t contain any added sugar. In fact Absolut is as clean as vodka can be. Still, it has a certain taste: Rich, full-bodied and complex, yet smooth and mellow with a distinct character of grain, followed by a hint of dried fruit.","Why change what's perfect?\nIn 1879, Lars Olsson Smith introduced the continuous distillation with which he made Absolut Rent Br\u00e4nnvin. Instead of the usual three or four times, the vodka was distilled an infinite number of times. 100 years later, it was reintroduced as Absolut. Just as then, Absolut is produced in Ahus, L.O. Smith\u2019s birth town. Also the place where the wheat used for making the vodka is grown. And since the way Absolut is made won\u2019t change, neither will the true taste of vodka.","Keeping natural ingredients natural\nThe main ingredients in Absolut Vodka are water and winter wheat. The water comes from a deep well in Ahus where it\u2019s protected from impurities. Winter wheat differs from other crops: it\u2019s sown in fall, and harvested the next one. Days in between it grows under the Swedish snow developing its hard grain. Also, the use of fertilizers is minimized."],"nutrition":"","attribute":{"849":{"id":452,"merchant_product_code":"14742","product_id":739,"attribute_id":849,"store_id":4,"merchant_id":4,"price":"88.99","stock":9,"created_date":"2018-12-04 15:45:19","updated_date":"2020-07-25 18:39:03","attribute_name":"Vodka Blue","discount_type":"","discount_value":"","unit":"liter","quantity":1,"actual_price":"88.99"}}},"741":{"product_id":741,"price":"99.99","product_name":"Gold Rum","discount_type":"","discount_value":"0","product_desc":"BACARDI Gold rum is the proud creation of the Maestros de Ron Bacardi.
