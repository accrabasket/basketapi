At the heart of J&B Rare are malt whiskies from Speyside, a region recognized as the superior area in Scotland for making single malt whisky. They provide the fruity, fresh quality you can taste, and also give J&B its light colour. Added to that are some of the finest grain whiskies Scotland has to offer. They help reveal the individual flavours of the various malts, unveiling the smooth character of J&B Rare.
