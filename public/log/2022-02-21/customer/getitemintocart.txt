As this rum slowly matures in the tropical Cuban climate it acquires its pale yellow colour and distinctive oaky notes, which combine with fresh fruit flavours and a hint of molasses from the rich Cuban sugar cane. The youngest drop in Havana Club 3 Anos is three years old. After 2 years the aguardiente is filtered through charcoal to remove impurities and goes back into barrel. It\u2019s difficult to imagine another white rum would exist with the same strength and complexity of aroma and flavour that Havana Club 3 Anos has.","default_discount_type":"","default_discount_value":"0","category_id":76,"custom_info":"{\"Ingredients\":\"Rum (Cuban Sugarcane distillate), Water, Cuban Cane Sugar.\",\"Warning\":\"Drinking distilled Spirits, Beer, Coolers, Wine and other Alcoholic Beverages may increase cancer risk, and, during pregnancy, can cause birth defects.\"}","brand_name":"Havana Club","commission_type":"","commission_value":"0.0000","discount_type":"","discount_value":"0","unit":"CL","quantity":100,"tax_value":"3"}},"productImageData":{"2399":[{"id":3474,"type":"product","image_id":2399,"image_name":"AFL510.jpg"}]}},"imageRootPath":"http:\/\/172.104.239.54\/basketapi\/public\/images"}
